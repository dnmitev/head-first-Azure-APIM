	File:		6 - retry.xml

	Summary:	This XML demonstrates applied policy for using the APIM to retry a
                call which might fail. The backend produces an exception whenver
                the current time has seconds dividable by three. The retry policy
                has been setup exponential without immediate first retry.
                This code sample is supposed to be used with the Demo API, and 
                the "GetDate_RandomException" operation which is currenly available on:
